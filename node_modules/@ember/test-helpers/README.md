# @ember/test-helpers [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/emberjs/ember-test-helpers.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/emberjs/ember-test-helpers)

A test-framework-agnostic set of helpers for testing Ember.js applications.

## Usage

The exports of this library are intended to be utility functions that can be used to bring the
standard Ember testing experience to any testing framework.

This library is best used by way of a test-framework-specific
wrapper, such as [ember-qunit](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit) or
[ember-mocha](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-mocha).

**Full documentation can be found in [API.md](API.md).**
